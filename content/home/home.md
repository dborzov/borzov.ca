## Hi, I am Dmitry Peter Borzov

I am a developer and I specialize in web and data analysis/processing applications. My experience includes working with javascript [d3, Angular, Ember], golang, python [pandas, scipy, django, flask] and C# among other technologies.

## Open source projects

See my [github account page for details](https://github.com/dborzov).

#### **lsp** - `ls` shell command alternative reimagined for modern times, with friendlier notations, built-in awareness of things like git repos and various dotfiles file datatypes.  

#### **NetVis** - a tool to visualize and understand networks. Translate your network logs to a simple JSON-based NetVis format and visualize the network events and communication in detail. Check out the [demo](http://www.borzov.ca/netvis/). Built in coordination with [IPFS team](http://ipfs.io/), NetVis is an indispensable tool when designing and developing network functionality on any level.

#### **RusticSearch** - is a simple search engine server. It uses in-memory suffix array to lookup index entries. RusticSearch is minimalistic in design and perfect when adding simple search functionality where [fancier solutions](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) can be an overkill.

## Writings

#### *Dec 2013* Predecessor search for Big Data: x-fast tries, locality of reference and all that

Introduction to X-fast trie-style data structures. Imagine you are developing a flight search website. You need to build a tailored search index that is really good at one task: for the given date and search criteria returns the list of the next flights. How is it better to approach designing this?

#### *May 2013* Floating-point considered harmful

Limitations of calculations based on floating-point are well known. We explore how using custom data types tailored for a task at hand allows for bypassing these.

Here is the list of academic peer-reviewed research papers I coauthored:
