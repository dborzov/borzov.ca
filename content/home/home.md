## Hi, I am Dmitry Peter Borzov

I am a developer who specializes on web and data analysis applications. My experience includes working with javascript [d3, Angular, Ember], golang, python [pandas, scipy] and C among other technologies. 

I come from academic background (check out the  peer-reviewed papers in theoretical physics I coauthored!) and that provided me with skills for deep quantative analysis in various areas. It comes handy now and then :)
