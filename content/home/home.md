## Hi, I am Dmitry Borzov

I do software development and data analysis. 

Keywords of the things I am into: network protocols, distributed algorithms, databases, machine learning.

## Open source projects

(also, see my [github account page](https://github.com/dborzov))

#### [**lsp**: `ls` shell command alternative](https://github.com/dborzov/lsp)

`ls`  reimagined for modern times, with friendlier notations, built-in awareness of things like git repos and various dotfiles file datatypes.  

#### [**NetVis**: a tool to visualize and understand networks](https://github.com/dborzov/netvis)

 Translate your network logs to a simple JSON-based NetVis format and visualize the network events and communication in detail. Check out the [demo](http://www.borzov.ca/netvis/). Built in coordination with [IPFS team](http://ipfs.io/), NetVis is an indispensable tool when designing and developing network functionality on any level.

#### [**RusticSearch**: a simple search engine server](https://github.com/dborzov/rusticsearch)

 It uses in-memory suffix array to lookup index entries. RusticSearch is minimalistic in design and perfect when adding simple search functionality where [fancier solutions](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) can be an overkill.

## Writings


#### [*June 2016* Analysis of randomized algorithms (Part I)](/posts/quicksort/)

Quantitative analysis of randomized algorithms may look intimidating, but a couple of simple tricks goes the long way. We look at how to build some intuition and understanding behind the algorithm's performance using the quicksort as an example.

#### [*March 2016* Fixing jmeter's java.security.cert.CertificateException error](/posts/jmeter)

A problem I had trying to make jmeter work on my machine and what fixed it

#### [*Dec 2015* Enabling iTerm's `Cmd+K` hotkey for Cygwin shell with ConEmu](/posts/cls4cygwin/)

Reproducing iTerm's `Cmd+K` in Windows Cygwin.

#### [*Jan 2015* Routing at Bittorrent: understanding Kademlia DHTs (Distributed Hash Tables)](/posts/kademlia/)

Using NetVis framework to visualize algorithms behind Kademlia-styled DHT.


#### [*Dec 2013* Predecessor search for Big Data: x-fast tries, locality of reference and all that](/posts/xfast/)

Introduction to X-fast trie-style data structures.
