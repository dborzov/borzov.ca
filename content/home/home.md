## Hi, I am Dmitry Peter Borzov

I specialize in development of web and data analysis applications. My experience includes working with javascript [d3, Angular, Ember, node], golang, python [pandas, scipy, django, flask] and C# among other technologies.

## Open source projects

(also, see my [github account page](https://github.com/dborzov))

#### [**lsp** - `ls` shell command alternative](https://github.com/dborzov/lsp)

`ls`  reimagined for modern times, with friendlier notations, built-in awareness of things like git repos and various dotfiles file datatypes.  

#### [**NetVis** - a tool to visualize and understand networks](https://github.com/dborzov/netvis)

 Translate your network logs to a simple JSON-based NetVis format and visualize the network events and communication in detail. Check out the [demo](http://www.borzov.ca/netvis/). Built in coordination with [IPFS team](http://ipfs.io/), NetVis is an indispensable tool when designing and developing network functionality on any level.

#### [**RusticSearch** - is a simple search engine server](https://github.com/dborzov/rusticsearch)

 It uses in-memory suffix array to lookup index entries. RusticSearch is minimalistic in design and perfect when adding simple search functionality where [fancier solutions](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) can be an overkill.

## Writings

#### [*Dec 2013* Predecessor search for Big Data: x-fast tries, locality of reference and all that](http://localhost:1313/posts/xfast/)

Introduction to X-fast trie-style data structures.

#### [*May 2013* Floating-point considered harmful](http://localhost:1313/posts/floating-point/)

Limitations of calculations based on floating-point are well known. We explore how using custom data types tailored for a task at hand allows for bypassing them.
