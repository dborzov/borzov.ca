+++

[Adventure Time with Finn and Jake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_Time) is a children's TV show I like. Here we are going to build a graph of all the show's characters with graph vertices for episodes where the two characters appear simulteniously. Then, we are going to implement some common graph algorithms which would allow us to explore this graph a litle bit for interesting properties.
