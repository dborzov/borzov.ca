# **Frenchirix and the Research of How to Learn Languages**

I've been working on this little side project i call [Frenchirix](https://frenchirix.borzov.ca/) in my spare time. The name is a spoof of [Asterix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix) (or if you are their copiright lawyer, of [ancient Gaulic names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vercingetorix) [[6]](#references)). 

In short, it's this little website I built to help my kids practice French with dialogue from a [cartoon French TV show they like](https://www.netflix.com/ca/title/81316606).

In this post, I want to share a bit on what I'm trying to do with it.

It started with me wanting to help my kids with French at school.

After some trial and error, we found a "one weird trick" that worked better than anything else. And it wasn't Duolingo.

The trick is **regular exposure to enjoyable French video content that the kids choose themselves**. It can be as little as 10-15 minutes a day; what matters is that it's regular (ideally, daily) and part of their routine.

But that's only part of it. It also needs to be complemented with **spaced repetition**: revisiting the same content, the same dialogue, and vocabulary every couple of days for some time.

This thing is designed to make this second part go a bit smoother: makes it easier to re-expose kids to French dialogue that's meaningful to them.

### **The Science of What Works for Language Learning**

I wanted the tool's design to be guided by established findings in science and research fields of language learning [\[1-5\]](#references).


I asked around and got in touch with people with university degrees in the fields that should be pertinent: linguistics, education and second language acquisition. I asked those folks for some recommendations for the best sources I can use to learn where these fields are at. 

You can see the [list of references I  got at the end of this post](#references).

A fair share of what they talk about in these sources is how their academic competitors got it wrong, and different "schools" in the subject and all that other stuff that's probably important to them, but we don't particularly care about.

So if we filter all that irrevelant stuff out, here's the actionable summary of **what works**, accordding to my understanding of these sources.

#### 1. Hardware-Accelerated Subconscious Learning

A computers person might say that the skill of communication is "hardware-accelerated" in our brains. The only language learning method that works is one that taps into this. 

For one thing, that means that Language acquisition's a bit akin to learning to ride a bike. It's about giving your subconscious the time and opportunity to figure things out. Your part is to keep "getting on the bike" and get out of the way.

Consciously studying _about_ the language (grammar, phonetics) helps about as much as physics lectures help you ride a bike.

That is, not that much, especially for kids and beginners [\[2, 3, 5\]](#references).

#### 2. Comprehensible Input First

I think this particular point was most counter-intuitive and surprising.

If language acquisition were a house, understanding input is building house foundation, and the ability to generate output is putting up a roof.

Brain studies suggest there is fundamentally only one way we acquire language: by practising understanding of the "**input**": reading and listening.

Producing language **output**—speaking and writing—is powered by this skill of **input** comprehension. 

And spending too much time on output before input comprehension is on sufficiently solid ground is overrated.


Anther aspect of it is that it's a good idea to hold off on constantly testing and evaluating how well a kid is doing. Soft and squishy biological things like our brains do not do progress bars that need to go to 100%.

One manifestation of this dynamic is that when babies learn their first language, they have this long "silent period" where they understand a great deal but speak very little [2].

This counter-intuitive point is somewhat hard to apply in practice for social reasons: when a person's watching cartoons, for example, and not barraged with output exercises all the time, **it just doesn't LOOK like she's learning**.

She's just not suffering enough.

#### 3. Misleading Context

Understanding other people is an instinct at the core of being human. Harnessing this superpower is the only path to acquiring another language.

Yet, the important distinction is that the instinct is for **using language to UNDERSTAND PEOPLE**, not to do well on conjugation quizzes.

This is not how a second language is often used in a classroom context, for example, where it's not a tool to communicate but rather a peculiar activity one is expected to do to please the adults.

To drive this point home, the second the teacher needs to say something truly important, she'll switch to English [1,4].

#### 4. Understanding is the Reward

Our innate language learning ability is powerful and can overcome significant hurdles, but only if it's used as a means to get to what's catnip to our brains: the reward of understanding a **meaningful and intriguing message**.

Let's spin up Duolingo or walk into a school French class.

_"Hier il pleuvait, mais aujourd'hui il fait beau"_.

-Oh, so that means it was raining? Where was it raining?
-Nowhere in particular, kiddo, it's just an example.
-So it's make-believe, or a lie?
-Not even that. It's nothing.

When we work with sentence examples where the point is to translate them into English, the meaning is irrelevant; it's this bizzare puzzle of translating one sequence of symbols to another.

Kids are wired to be great at mapping words to meaning. Soing puzzles where you map words to some other words is not that:

![Img](http://localhost:1313/img/rain.png)

Imagine [Professor Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) devising another cruel experiment: conditioning his poor dogs to become bored and zone out at the sound of French. How would you do it? 

You flood them with sentences that mean nothing.

#### 5. Exposure to Authentic Language

It's often pointed out that naturally spoken French is so different from "textbook French" that it's reasonable to treat them as two separate languages:

- **Spoken French**. The language millions of people use to communicate.
- **Textbook French**. A dead language for books and exercises. Like Latin.

Which one's worth it? The answer is obvious.

Yes, if you just take any random utterance from the street said by one native to another in their natural habitat of, say France or Quebec, it won't be a good learning material. 

But that's true for any language.

Language used in kids' TV shows is a particularly good fit for "spoken language".

When kids' TV shows are produced, there are millions of dollars at stake. Hundreds of people can work on a show for years. People's careers and mortgages are on the line.

You can be sure they've made certain the show is understandable to French-speaking children of various ages and levels of language mastery.

Alright, so what are the arguments in favour of "textbook French" then?

Many of these arguments resemble those in favour of learning Latin. We're told that this is the only "true" version. We get to hear arguments involving people who died long time ago. We are told that it's how things have always been done. We hear that the "ne" in "Je ne sais pas" is important because it comes from Latin negation, so it must live there forever. We are told that those who mumble "Schpaah" instead are despicable uncultured low-lives who are wrong in their ways.

If you cast all that aside, the only potentially solid argument is that "spoken French," like any oral language, lacks a writing system that fits its needs.

But let's be honest, no French does.

#### 6. Winging It Is Part of the Process

In traditional language classes, there's a focus on catching a student who hasn't really understood every part of the language input. The student must be called out and face consequences for this "crime."

It turns out that not understanding everything—and not obsessing over it—is an integral part of how our brains naturally learn.

We do this all the time, and, for one more reason to leave the learner alone, we do it mostly unconsciously [1,2].

# **Frenchirix**

With this background in mind, here’s are the ideas I have in building Frenchirix:

#### 1. Design based on science
First and foremost, the idea is to design for what we know to actually work for language learning. 

In particular, try the things that are clearly undeserved by the other educational resources available for kids. 

The idea is not to build something just because it meets people's expectations of what language learning should be like.

#### 2. Design driven by the feedback
I am building this first and foremost for my kids. 

The design is driven by the feedback I get from them using the app.

#### 3. Practicing Comprehensible Input
This app is specifically focused on help kids practice understanding audio input of native French media content. I do not want to get distracted by other things here.

If I can make a tool that helps with just this particular thing and does it well and properly, that would be awesome.

#### 5. Spaced Repetition

And the point is to use the power of spaced repetition.

Gamification mechanic for daily practice to encourage regular spaced repetition. 

The goal is to get the kids to three-five minutes of working through the same dialogue on four or five occasions, spaced by two to three days apart.

#### 6. Anchor to Meaning, Not Other Words

Using French versions of shows your child already loves in English is our golden ticket.

To the kid, the dialogue from it is not a bunch of foreign words: it's a story he's immersed in, the characters, and the emotions.

The French dialogue they see in the app is soaked in this existing context.

#### 7. Avoid Getting Stuck

In the mini-game design, it's important to avoid situations where a kid gets stuck and frustrated.

For example, in a mini-game where words from a scene must be matched to their translations, the full dialogue is also presented on the same page. So the word translations (answer keys, if you will) can be viewed in the given context with only a few taps.

That means that any mini-game can be solved easily without prior knowledge of relevant French; and it will only take a little bit longer.

The point is to re-expose the child to meaningful French, not to test them.


There you have it, the thinking behind this little side project of mine called Frenchirix. Maybe your kids will find it useful too.

6. Since some people were wondering: yes, the website currently uses some dialogue lines from a Netflix TV show as language examples for educational purposes. As a non-commercial educational website, this use fully meets the conditions of "fair use" doctrine in US and "fair dealing" in Canada. Still, we all know that this never stopped some of those companies with lawyers that need to find ways to justify their salaries. Therefore, the idea is to focus on building the data processing pipeline that will work for any media, not the specific one currently used. This way, the second that specific copyright owners express diagreement with this particular use, the public version of this website will switch to something else.
