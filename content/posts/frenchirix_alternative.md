# **Frenchirix and the Research of How to Learn Languages**

I've been working on a little side project: [Frenchirix](https://frenchirix.borzov.ca), a tool to help my kids practice French with dialogue from a cartoon TV show they like. Check it out, maybe you will find it useful.

Here's a bit on where the idea came from. 

It started with me wanting to help my kids with French at school.

After some trial and error, we found this "one weird trick" that worked better than other things. And it wasn't Duolingo.

The thing that worked was:
1.  **regular exposure to enjoyable French video content that the kids themselves got to choose**. It can be as little as 10-15 minutes, what matters is that it's regular (ideally, daily), and a part of their routine.

2.Complemented with **spaced repetition**. Revisiting the same content, the same dialogue and vocabulary every couple of days. 

I built this tool to handle that second part: through mini-games re-expose kids with dialogue we touched upon earlier, in a low pressure way.

### The Science of What Works for Language Learning

The design of the tool was guided by what I've been reading up on the science and research of language learning [1-4].

Here's a summary of **THE THINGS THAT WORK** based on my understanding of these sources:

#### Exposure for Subconscious Learning
Much like learning to ride a bike, language acquisition is about giving your subconscious the time and chances to figure things out. Your part is just to keep "getting on the bike" and get out of the way. 

Consciously studying *about* the language (grammar, phonetics) helps about as much as physics lectures help you ride a bike. 

That is, not that much, especially for kids and beginners [2, 3].  

#### Comprehensible Input First
Brain studies suggest there's fundamentally one way we acquire language: by practising understanding of the "**input**": reading and listening.

Producing language **output**—speaking and writing—can only be built later, on top of the solid foundation of this acquired **input** comprehension. Spending too much time on it before that is overrated. 

Ii's also a good idea to hold your horses with testing and evaluating how good the kid's doing all the time. Babies, for example, when they learn their first language, go through a "silent period" where they understand a great deal but speak very little [2]. It's a part of the natural process.

I think this is the most counter-intuitive and least practiced part on this list. 

It's also somewhat hard to apply in practice for social reasons: when a person's watching cartoons, and not barraged with output exercises all the time, **it doesn't LOOK like she's learning**. 

She's just not suffering enough. 

#### Misleading Context
Sharks are natural-born hunting machines. For humans, our natural superpower is understanding other people and learning about the world around us though this communication. It' harnessing this instinct that's the only path to acquiring another language. 

Yet, the important distinction is that the instinct is for **using the language to UNDERSTAND PEOPLE**. Not to do well at conjugation quizzes. 

To the kid's brain it's hard to see the context in which she's engaging with another language, as the tool to communicate. It's more of doing a special puzzle to please the grownups. 

It's hard to see that, say, in classroom, where the second the teacher needs to communicate something that's actually important, she'll say that in English.

The instinct won't be fooled when there is no blood in the water [1,4].

#### Understanding is the Reward

Our innate language learning ability is powerful and can overcome significant hurdles, but only if it's used as  means to get to what matters  – the reward  –  understanding a **meaningful and intriguing message**. 

Let's spin up Duolingo. Walk into a school French class. Lots and lots of sentences.


*"Hier il pleuvait, mais aujourd'hui il fait beau"*. 

Where was it raining? 

Nowhere in particular, it's just an example. 

So, it's a make-believe, or a lie? Not even that.


#### Stories and games

Kids who grow up bilingual have no problem expressing themselves in both languages. What will stump them, especially the young ones, is asking to translate. To their brains, there are no "languages". Only speaking in a way where they will be understood.

We take sentences deprived of any meaning, basically a string of words. We converting this into a string of words in a different language.  We obsess over doing this brainteaser over and over again.





#### Exposure to Authentic Language
It's a well-worn point that naturally-spoken French is very different from the "textbook French."

The spoken French is what millions of people use to communicate. 
"Textbook French" is a dead language for books. Like Latin. 

Which one's worth it? To me the answer is obvious. 
 
The spoken French language of TV shows for kids is a particularly perfect fit as an  exposure to real French. When kid's TV shows are produced, that are millions of dollars at stake. There are people's careers and their artistic aspirations involved, hundreds of people working hard on a show for years. You better believe they made sure the show's language is comprehensible by native French kids.  

And it's just not true that "spoken French" is more complicated that the "textbook French". 

Yes, like any informal dialect, "spoken French" is hard because it does not have a writing system: the letters and the spelling that fits language's needs.

But let's be honest, no French does.

#### Winging It Is Part of the Process 
In traditional language learning, it's common to catch a kid who's winging it and didn't really understand some parts of their "language input." The kid must face the consequences for their crime. 

It turns out, not understanding everything – and not obsessing over it – is how our brains naturally operate and an integral part of the natural learning process. 

We do this all the time and, as one more reason to leave the kid alone, we do this mostly unconsciously \[1,2\].

# **What Worked for My Kids**

Here’s how we apply these concepts:

####  Short, Daily Exposure 
Consistency beats cramming. 10-15 minutes of enjoyable French video daily, and going over the dialogue without too much pressure.  

####   Going through Familiar, Enjoyable Content
French versions of shows your child already loves in English are the golden ticket. Understanding the plot, the characters, and the emotions serves as the scaffolding on which everything else can be built.  

####  The Dark Force of Screentime
As with nuclear power, this is a case where the dark power can be used for good. Practising French with live people can lead to negative emotions:  anxiety, boredom, frustration can compound [4].

This is where the soma effect of vivid, compelling and yet forgiving, low pressure, low stakes environment is at its best.
